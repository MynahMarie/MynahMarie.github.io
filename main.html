      <p>Albert Einstein said: â€œThe important thing is to not stop questioning;
        curiosity has its own reason for existing." In this day and age of rapid technological advancement,
        this statement takes a new dimension.<br></br>
        Born in 2017 from the vivid imagination of composer and musician Mynah Marie, Earth To Abigail
        strives to redefine more traditional genres of music by intergrating new mediums of expression
        such as Live Coding and DIY instrument making as well as using loops and samples. The goal is to use technology to
        recreate a full experience for the audience while being alone on stage.
        Curiosity is the main motivator for Earth To Abigail. The thirst to learn new things and find new ways
        of expanding as an artist. Earth To Abigail wishes to communicate this curiosity to everyone experiecing the music.
        This desire is pushed by the strong belief that we are now living in a great time of change and anything
        bringing awareness and knowledge to people is a good thing.<br></br>

        Mynah Marie has been living the life of a nomad for the past 15 years. Her past work as a musician
        led her to collaborate with an impressive variety of artists, from Mexico with the latin fusion band Casa Verde Colectivo
        to India with the bollywood singer Arijit Singh with stops in France, Italty, Israel, Spain, California, Nepal and Egypt along the way.
        The necessity of creating a project that could give her the creative freedom of a solo act without feeling limited
        from the boundaries of being alone on stage was precisely derived from the nomadic way of life.
        The impossibility of finding a stable group of people to play with for an extended period of time led
        to dream about creating a "band of machines" or at least to start with creating a setup that could fit in a suitcase
        and be powerful enough to play big stages. Also inspired by her newly aquired passion for coding and programming, Mynah wanted
        bring into her new project elements that could transcend the music and open conversations and hopefully the curiosity about
        coding and science in general and the place of technology in our lives today and how we could possibly
        make better use of it.
